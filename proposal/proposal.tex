\section{Motivation}
We will be competing in the 2015 Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge hosted by Kaggle Inc.  The goal of the competition is to correctly classify malware into families based on file content and characteristics.  Malware is becoming much more prevalent and smarter at avoiding detection by anti-malware software.  Recently, malware authors have started modifying their files to look like many different classes of files.  This makes the problem of detecting malware much more difficult.  In order to effectively handle malware, it is helpful to classify them into families that capture their behavior and motivations.  Our problem is to learn how to classify malware to 9 given families by using a large training test.  In addition, there is a \$16,000 prize for the winner.
\section{Statement of Problem}
Given a training set of malware files that have been correctly labeled, our goal is to generate probabilities $p_{ij}$ that a file $i$ is in family $j$. Suppose $y_{ij}$ is 1 if file $i$ is in class $j$ and 0 otherwise. Then, the loss of our predictions on the test data set with $N$ files and $M$ families is
\[ \mathrm{log loss} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M y_{ij} \log (p_{ij}) . \]
While we have access to these test files, Microsoft has the correct labels and will return our log loss for a given set of probabilities. 
The competition ends on April 17th with the winner determined by the lowest log loss. 
\section{General Approach}
We first want to familiarize ourselves with the format of the data, and extract what we guess are important characteristics of the binary malware files and disassembly output, thus generating the features that we would like our machine learning algorithms to use.  Next, we would design a train-validate-test work flow that uses the extracted features to predict the required probabilities. We will use the methods we learn in class in designing the learning stages of our algorithm, possibly combining and innovating several different methods. We will also be checking the position of our test score on the competition leaderboard.
\section{Resources}
Microsoft provides a large training set of data (18gb compressed, 500gb uncompressed) and we will need enough space to work with data of this magnitude.  We may need additional computational support than what we have already.

\section{Schedule}
\begin{description}
	\item[2/28] We should have a good understanding of how the data is represented in the provided files.  Create backend and partition the data using a trivial learning algorithm.
	\item[3/15] Implement basic techniques with non-trivial features. 
	\item[3/31] Implement more innovative hybrid machine learning methods.  
	\item[4/15] Experiment with algorithm to get best score possible.
	\item[4/17] Submit final machine learning algorithm to Microsoft.
	\item[5/1] Give presentation.
	\item[5/11] Finish report.
